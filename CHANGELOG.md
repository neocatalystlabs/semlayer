# Changelog

## v0.1.0-beta.1 (2026-07-18)

First public beta.

- **Inference pipeline**: Profile (batched stats + typed rule pipeline + LLM
  escalation), Link (corroborated FK discovery; zero-trap hard gate), Describe
  (2-pass context propagation), Enrich (dictionary decodes, metrics,
  aggregate reconciliation with business-rule discovery, deprecation,
  freshness, routing).
- **Format**: open spec with confidence/provenance/lifecycle envelope,
  fan-out safety, hierarchies, aggregate routing, and a normative consumer
  contract (spec/SPEC.md).
- **CLI**: `infer` (`--no-llm`, `--no-sample-egress`), `review`, `drift`,
  `mcp`, `export` (dbt), `validate`, `init`.
- **Connectors**: Snowflake, BigQuery, DuckDB. LLM: Anthropic API
  (Haiku-tier default).
- **Evaluation, shipped**: 9 fixture warehouses, gold semantic layers,
  82-question CQ suites, reproducible benchmark
  (messy-warehouse: 0.34 raw → 0.53 with the layer; clean-schema negative
  result published).
- Measured: ~$0.70/100 tables inference cost; ~1-point accuracy cost for
  no-sample-egress; drift feed latency (Snowflake sample: 2.2 min).

Known gaps: Bedrock/Vertex routing; LookML/RDF/Ossie exporters; hierarchy
auto-inference (review-queued by design pending corroboration signals);
hosted service.
